# API Stability Levels

Here are the various levels of API stability for our application's gRPC and REST interfaces.

## Alpha Endpoints

Alpha endpoints are experimental and intended for initial testing. They are not guaranteed to be stable and may change significantly without notice.

- API Stability: Poor
- Testing Coverage: Poor

## Beta Endpoints

Beta endpoints are generally stable and suitable for integration testing, but they might still undergo minor changes. The API is considered mostly final, but isn't yet fully production-ready.

- API Stability: Strong
- Testing Coverage: Fair

## General Availability (GA) Endpoints

GA endpoints are stable, fully tested, and ready for production use. These APIs will not change unless absolutely necessary, and any changes would be considered a major update.

- API Stability: Strong
- Testing Coverage: Strong
